# Elderly Monitoring System

The objective of this system is to provide comprehensive monitoring of an elderly person’s activities. It puts forth two key functionalities - stillness detection and pose detection. By analyzing an elderly individual’s posture, this system can identify potential risks and enable timely care. This reduces risks caused due to delayed responses to physiological conditions.  We aimed to build a highly accurate pose detection model, integrated with a stillness detection system, that warns an individual's family when no action is detected for extended durations. The system is designed to be user-friendly and has an intuitive interface.
